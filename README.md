# CryptoAlgorithm

As We all know, a digital asset or currency based on blockchain technology is a cryptocurrency. There are cryptocurrency exchanges where cryptocurrencies may be exchanged, just like there are stock exchanges. In this project, I am doing Fetch the Cryptocurrency market prices and data in the form of CAD, Performing a fundamental analysis of market behaviour, Implementing a simple algorithmic trading strategy, and analysing the trading algorithm's performance. For the analysis, I used python language.

A technique for obtaining previous market data is already included in the yfinance library. I used this to get the Bitcoin to Canadian Dollar conversion rate for the years 2021-2022. used the download() function and supplied the ticker ("BTC-CAD"), start and finish dates, and the time between data points. Use an interval of one day.
